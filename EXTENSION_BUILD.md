# Build Zimbra OSE 2FA Extension

## Introduction

There are more traditional ways of building a Zimbra Extension. You might want to check those on [https://github.com/Zimbra/zm-extension-guide](https://github.com/Zimbra/zm-extension-guide).
This is my way which involves using an spare VPS where you install Zimbra 8.8.15.

## Requisites

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Zimbra 8.8.15 installed

- ant (Does not matter too much if Distro JDK version that does not match Zimbra's JDK version.)

```
apt update
apt install ant git make zip
```

## Prepare build environment

```
sudo su - zimbra
mkdir -p /opt/zimbra/conf/scripts
cd /opt/zimbra/conf/scripts
git clone 'https://github.com/btactic/zimbra-ose-2fa.git'

cd zimbra-ose-2fa/extension
ln -s /opt/zimbra/lib/jars lib
```

## Build

```
sudo su - zimbra

cd /opt/zimbra/conf/scripts/zimbra-ose-2fa/extension
ant jar
```

Sample build output:
```

.

## Jar

A new jar file should be found at:
```
/opt/zimbra/conf/scripts/zimbra-ose-2fa/extension/zetatwofactorauth.jar
```
.
